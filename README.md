                                      *ESC electronic speed controller
                                      * transmitter and receiver : Flysky Fs-i6
                                      * Gyrosensor MPU-6050
                                      * Brushless motors 1000kV
                                      * Frame DJI F450
## prog 1 setup:
                  first it checks all the controls and checks the initial position of the drone .
##  prog 2 esc callibrate :
                   basically it checks the working of the motors for the flight(speed).
## prog 3 flight controller :
                   it uses gyroscope program to maintain a reference direction in the drone and provides stability.
